1,Tacorea,1,1,4.5,2017-9-22,"Yummy cheese quesadillas + my favorite Korean marinated bbq dish\, bulgogi = Tacorea's Lil Kodak  quesadilla that I never knew I needed in my life! Holy! It was so juicy and flavorful with that right amount of sweetness that is always expected from bulgogi. They make an awesome California Burrito too with all of the essentials - carne asada\, guacamole\, cheese\, pico de gallo AND switches up from the classic french fries to a childhood favorite - tator tots. so thoroughly happy with our orders and will definitely come back again!",256,290,86
2,"Golden Boy Pizza",2,2,2,2014-10-3,"Finally an affordable pizza place that I can go on a regular basis. I go to Chinatonw pretty much everyday (I'm from Hong Kong) and recently decided to venture into little Italy\, or Littly as my friends and I like to call it. And even though food here is still cheaper than the rest of the city\, it's still alittle over my budget as a newly grad unemployed college student. But Golden Boy is well within my budget\, and the people are nice and hardworking. Usually I don't tip my waitors and waitresses very much since I just find them rude most of the time. But the people at Golden Boy Pizza really dig their job and do it really well - that I admire very much and I'm happy to say that I will be tipping very generously whenever I come here to get that delicious.",209,282,57
3,"Hot Sauce and Panko",3,3,4,2016-8-6,"Pretty good wings had the srg (hot garlic bacon and Parm) and the panco covered wings with the waffle. The waffle was tasty but the waffle was a little soggy from the butter. Will be coming back taste all the other flavor of wings. Don't forget to take a look at all the hot sauces",363,299,32
4,"El Farolito",4,4,5,2018-9-12,"I had the chance to try El Farolito after several friends recommended it to me as a MUST while visiting the Mission District in SF. The neighborhood and subsequently the city is known for it's rich history of Mexican cuisine dating back all the way to the Mexican-American war. This specific area of SF is known for the different restaurants that serve up the classics (i.e. burritos\, quesadillas\, etc.). However\, El Farolito is apparently is THE PLACE for amazing Mexican cuisine in the Bay Area so I know I had to try it.",157,276,85
5,Volcano,5,5,2,2017-7-3,"My colleagues wanted to try this place for lunch today so we ordered a bunch of dishes. I was not in the mood for curry so I ordered a tempura udon which comes with a side salad and miso soup. Udon soup was lukewarm with spinach floating in it. Udon noodles were plentiful but the tempura was a dry oily piece of fried vegetable which ruined the meal. I would come back here to try their curry but no for their udon noodle soup!",313,222,88
6,"The Bird",6,6,5,2015-5-11,"One of the best chicken sandwiches I've ever had. Quick line and fast service makes what looks like a long wait short. If you're in the area it's must try",453,268,21
7,"Pacific Eatery",7,7,3,2014-8-18,"Tasty and fresh takeaway options for those seeking a break from chain restaurants catering to tourists. While their menu is limited (think 4-6 items)\, you may add slices of avocado or chicken/salmon for $2 here or $4 there.  In addition to a few salad options\, they offer Pho\, Curry\, and Loco Moco.   Since I was feeling the need to green my lunch\, I opted for their salad bowl and added chicken.  They grilled my chicken while I waited and I could hear the gentleman behind the counter slicing away.  My salad bowl was a tumble of fresh spinach leaves\, Napa cabbage\, salad mix\, green apples\, strawberries\, and pineapple chunks.  The salad dressing was a savory soy sesame concoction that gave a good balance to my salad.",494,191,75
8,"Super Duper Burgers",8,8,5,2017-4-17,"I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PLACE!! It makes me really sad that I can't have it all the time (being from Davis and all)\, so I get really excited every time I'm in the city and I'm able to get a burger. This place never disappoints! The burgers are always super juicy and definitely hits the spot.",390,79,90
9,Yamo,9,9,1,2018-7-6,"Yuck!! Part of me feels horrible for writing this review but honestly I wish this review existed before I walked way too far for this. Food is tasteless. Burmese is one of my favorite foods and I love it for its rich flavors. This place was so so so bland. Service is horrendous. The girl at the counter is flat out rude and dismissive\, almost as if it's her schtick. But it's off putting and really not cute.The place is filthy. I by no means have high standards for ambiance when there is good food involved (my favorite Burmese place is nothing fancy at all) but this place is dirty. You can watch them prepare all the food and I literally saw utensils being reused and put back in little nooks. THEN an exterminator came in and started doing a routine inspection and collection\, so disgusting. It's cheap\, and that might be the only upside but definitely not cheap enough to make up for everything else.",133,128,71
10,Fayala,10,10,5,2016-4-20,"Fayala is a hidden gem in the business district. For lunch\, they offer buffet and sandwiches made to order. I eat at the buffet at least three times a week. The selection changes regularly\, but their fish is a solid tasty stable. The salad bar is constantly refilled with fresh vegetables and if you're a fan of beets\, this is the place. Four kinds of greens and a variety that'd satisfy vegans. Friendly\, professional staff that make rush time look easy. TL;DR: Great place for lunch.",231,0,45
11,"Sam Wo Restaurant",11,11,2,2017-3-20,"I ate here once because this place is known for their fresh noodle wraps.  That was the only thing worth getting.  The wonton noodle soup and jook was way below par and the rice dishes bland.  This place might have been featured on the tonight show but I'm not going to be tuning in to this spot anytime soon.  Service was better than expected",304,95,60
12,"Street Taco",12,12,1,2016-4-26,"I have lived in San Francisco more than 35 years. I love taquerias.  I love tacos.  I love San Francisco tacos. I have eaten hundreds -- probably thousands -- of tacos at taquerias in and around San Francisco as well as up and down the West Coast and throughout Mexico\, New Mexico and Texas. I can without hesitation say that the tacos we had at at Street Taco were the worst I have ever had. The nice-looking homemade style corn tortillas were soggy\, the texture of very wet cardboard.  The grayish meat had a similar texture. (The word 'mushy' comes to mind.)  Topped with a paltry dollop of not super fresh Pico de Gallo\, the flavors melded to create a taste that was vaguely reminiscent of... well\, of nothing.  To say the taste was bland would be inaccurate because 'bland' indicates the presence of at least some flavor\, some taste.  These tacos were bizarrely virtually tasteless.  I mean I had to put salt on the tacos (on carnitas no less!) to sense any flavor.",219,247,73

14,DragonEats,14,14,1,2017-7-17,"Such a huge disappointment! Especially for the price! Why is this place so popular! I don't understand AT ALL.

18,"Tu Lan",18,18,5,2017-9-6,"Tu Lan is definitely a hidden gem. I grew up eating here and this place was actually my first experience eating Vietnamese food. It's definitely a hole in the wall but based on experience\, hole in the walls have the best food. My family and I typically order the ginger fish\, Vietnamese fried rice\, imperial rolls\, HK style noodles and the pork kebabs. The food is so incredibly delicious and no other place even compares.",384,295,78
19,"Mae Krua",19,19,5,2016-12-23,"They can cook spicy Thai food\, without the chili overpowering the flavor of the food. When you ask for very spicy here\, you get very spicy food.

I had a savory crepe - sautéed peppers & onions\, jack&cheddar\, and seasoned chicken. They didn't skimp in the meat at all - there was at least 4-5oz in here! The owner was very kind and didn't charge my little for whipped cream on her Nutella strawberry crepe. Overall tally price for 2 crepes was $17 but they were huge and really good! The crepe is thick enough to hold all of the filling so it wasn't as messy to eat as other crepes I've had.",110,12,80

The lame excuse from the lady behind the counter was the bill's already rung up. Ok\, but what part of my repping didn't you see? Christ my call letters pretty much jump out at you.

Owners are incredibly friendly\, and my colleague and I are from the UK & TN respectively\, so not even like we are locals.

Yes\, it can be on the pricier side if you order per piece but I would recommend doing the sashimi moriawase which is a 12 piece sashmi tasting. At 39 dollars\, it is definitely more economical than ordering 12 individual pieces (ranging from 4-7 dollars per piece).",312,105,0
35,"Caffe Macaroni",35,35,3,2017-11-28,"I have so many mixed emotions about this place.  I can see why it has great ratings but I can also see why it has some terrible ones. We walked up on a Saturday night with no reservations at about 930pm.  There were only 2 other tables taken.  The dining room itself is literally the cutest thing.  It is tiny and cute and transports you to a whimsical place.  Mario (the owner?) was standing outside to greet us but it seemed like he was upset we were coming in.  I sat at the wrong seat and he yelled at me. I wanted to like this place but it just didn't happen.",315,288,30

Even if you went twice in one week\, the dishes may be different.  I'm all about value\, but it has to taste great\, which Trestle completely delivers.  The chicken was moist and the vegetables that it came with was crispy.  The red pepper soup was a pleasant surprise.  It was slightly sweet and had a depth of red pepper flavor.

Our waiter first served a cup of chicken consomme followed by bread with strawberry butter. The bread was crunch on the outside and very soft inside. Then\, we got our three tray high tea fare. Both the savory and sweet items were delicious. Savory pesto scone in particular was special. The clotted cream and strawberry jam with sweet scone was the perfect combo. The crab cone and brie over ham bruschetta also stood out. I tried the Anji white tea (although it tastes more like green tea). \nI highly recommend tea service at the Rotunda.",269,192,30

Plan on getting there 15 min before and you'll be 5 min early probably.  Our fav was the amberjack\, hirame\, Japanese sweetfish with cucumber and the plate of assorted tapas.

Towards the end of the meal\, I didn't feel like eating anymore\, but I wasn't stuffed.  It was a great experience.  I arrived late 20 min late and was still able to experience the upstairs/lounge area and had some snacks or whatnot.  The dining environment was very different for me.  I'm always used to being in my own world and enjoying my food.  I'm not much of a social person and both parties from either side did not bother me.  Maybe they thought I didn't speak english?  Who knows.  My date loved the experience and food.  The food wasn't to my liking\, but it was still very tasty.  For every meal\, the chef will come out and explain how the dish was cooked.  That is a very nice touch and made the dining experience better.\nIt was hard not to give them five stars but I've been to a lot of Michelin-starred restaurants lately and I feel that Benu's ambiance was not up to par with the likes of Quince or Atelier Crenn.  The dining hall felt dark and did not have the opulence or the warmth I experienced at other restaurants at this price level.  Service was good but not up to par with others (this is also an area where other two and three star Michelin restaurants excel).  It's a C for ambiance and a B- for hospitality.  I also wished they offered a non-alcoholic beverage pairing (other than tea) to really enhance the overall experience.\nI feel like I've checked off a bucket list item by coming here but I really don't think I would recommend Benu.

Secondly\, the small/intimate dining room makes the experience feel higher quality (extreme opposite of a churn and burn AYCE sushi buffet). Thirdly and most importantly\, the food is amazing. There's no need to go into detail about the food when you know it's going to be good and you just need to let the magic occur.

88,"Atelier Crenn",88,88,5,2017-7-2,"This place is definitely hard to rate... I think a solid 4.5 but I will round up to a 5! The restaurant is absolutely amazing in terms of creativity\, presentation\, uniqueness\, artistry\, and the like... it makes you feel like you are really experiencing something very special! The menu come in the form of a poem so you will have a great time trying to guess what the next course will be. There were multiple courses (around 14 ish) and each course was a perfectly sized bite or taste of something delicious. I think there was much more gastronomy here than it other restaurants in sf (reminds me of my experience at guy savoy.) \nHowever\, a couple of things prevents me from giving this place a solid 5 Star. This place was by far the most creative place I have been in sf but\, compared to my experience at Coi\, I don't think the flavors of any of the dishes were like WOAH! To be fair\, between Coi and here\, this place was more consistently good whereas Coi has hit or miss dishes. However\, where Coi hit it really hit. Not sure what it is about this place but in every dish a particular flavor or texture prevented the ingredients from reaching their full potential (for example the crunchiness and flavor of the pastry tart and strong flavor of the Stone fruit of the uni geoduck tart prevented the uni flavor from really shining through.) Thus\, I would probably say these places end up being around equal overall.\n Another thing is my bf has dietary restrictions which I mentioned when making the reservation. While the restaurant called to check what foods are ok and what are not\, we still ended up being served a dish with an ingredient on his no eat list. That was a bit unfortunate and the restaurant was extremely apologetic... even going so far as to making other dishes extra special which I greatly appreciate. However\, this experience was different from when I told Coi about my bf's restriction and they had prepare totally different entrees and dishes ahead of time to accommodate. \nAll in all\, I think this is a must try in sf and I would rate it above Coi because of its creativity. However\, I think there is room to grow!!",100,0,2

Only downside is the parking since it's very hard to find street parking and only parking garages are available... if they're not full. Came here for my graduation dinner and had a party of 5. Online reservations only showed up to parties of 4 so I called and asked. They were very nice and told me to just put down party of 5 in the notes so they can prepare in advance. When we arrived\, we had our own private room!! Service was also very attentive even though we were separated from the main dining room.\nMy favorite of the menu has to be the foie gras in espresso reduction! This was amazing and never would I have thought to pair foie gras with coffee! Even though the reduction was very bitter\, I didn't mind. It just went so well together. \nMy second favorite is the uni with carrot purée. Even though the whole dish was very mushy\, the sweet carrot went really well with the uni.\nThe most surprising course was the cheese course. I was expecting the normal cheese and charcuterie board but instead out came a peach! The white peach with mascarpone cheese was surprisingly delicious. I also very much enjoyed the dessert. The strawberry sorbet went well with the yogurt ice cream. I was glad the white chocolate wasn't too sweet. \nOverall\, a very pleasant experience and I would come back!",331,2,0

It just so happens that Quince makes it worth it. My tastebuds are new and fresh. I've been working on becoming very selective about what I eat.\nSo we went for the caviar. In a world where there's so much fraud - including ingredients - if this caviar is faux\, I will say they did a damn amazing job of making it seem real. Same with the lamb. We didn't even drink wine.

Eight Tables by George Chen honestly topped quite a few of them in terms of the dining experience. \n The restaurant is hidden in the back of an alley in Chinatown\, but once you step in\, you will find out that it is a spacious and elegantly-decorated\, luxurious venue with an army of well-trained staff who dress way better than you and are ready to pour your wine very generously. \n During the meal\, Chef Chen came to our table\, greeting us and giving us a brief introduction about his concept on the dishes. I liked how he blended traditional Chinese sayings or concepts with a modern cooking method. For example\, the first dish 'Jiu Gong Ge' represents the nine essential flavors of Chinese cuisine. I always think the first dish of a fine dining experience should be carefully set up because it will define the tone for the entire night. This first dish is like an opening of an opera or an introduction of the author of a book. From 'Jiu Gong Ge' and its presentation\, I could immediately tell I would be guided through the journey of an authentic Chinese meal with a modern twist. One of the desserts was a sponge-cake-liked bite that I had when I grew up in China. It instantly brought back my childhood memories and gave a nostalgic feeling. \n Our night was also made by Eight Tables' delightful and knowledgeable sommelier. The way he described the pairing wines made us feel entertained\, welcomed\, but also respected. Obviously\, compared to him\, we know very little about wine. However\, he managed to channel his passion for wine in a very humble way which put us at ease.\n In the end\, we were offered a tour of the kitchen to conclude this top-notch experience. The endeavor that Chef Chen and his staff put in to make their guests feel welcomed and well taken care of was impeccable. I highly recommend Eight Tables and look forward to coming back again soon.",26,0,0

I have been here several times and each time was worse than the previous. On my last and final visit to this restaurant\, my work bag and personal items were stolen from the valet service of Jardiniere. Here is my horrible experience at this restaurant from the food to the customer service. The awful meal and service: \n When we arrived at the restaurant\, the service was subpar. I ordered a glass of wine and it must have taken 15 minutes before it was served. The pour was skimpy\, less than a quarter of the glass. \n I ordered the duck entree and it was extremely dry and bland. The dish was tasteless\, which was very surprising coming from a so-called nice restaurant. My friend\, whom I was with\, had a similar experience with his dish as well. \n I ordered an espresso after the meal. We had to ask the waiter three times before it was brought. When the waiter finally brought the beverage\, it was a cup of coffee. I had clearly stated three times I wanted espresso. \n The stolen items by Jardinere Valet Service: \n After work\, I went directly to this restaurant. There was no parking on the streets so I valet parked my car with the restaurant. I placed my work bag and personal duffle bag in the trunk of my car. When I got home after dinner\, the items were gone. I immediately called the restaurant and George Perezvelez\, the manager offered to help. He promised to inform the owner of the restaurant and stated I will hear back from Traci Des Jardins within a day. \n George also stated he would be off work the next two days\, but will follow up. I returned to the restaurant the next day to take pictures of the valet sign to verify it had no disclaimer. To my surprise\, I saw George at the restaurant. Not only did he lie about being gone\, the owner never returned my email. Not to my surprise\, I never heard back from this restaurant again. I tried to contact them several times\, but I was given no response. I filed a police report with details of the incident. If anyone wants to see a copy of the police report\, I would be happy to share. \n Jardinere doesn't even deserve a one star. Needless to say\, the absent of professionalism speaks for itself.

The service was impeccable and the presentation beautiful but... unfortunately I didn't feel like I was wowed by any particular dish. It felt sort of like... overpriced Asian food. WHICH TO BE FAIR\, I understand it's elevated and also I have a general dislike of Americanized Asian food so take this review as you well but... I was really hoping for this to be more of a mind blowing experience since it was a three Michelin Star restaurant. I feel like cooked Asian food usually has a strong flavor profile but the dishes here fell flat. It was disappointing since this place is so highly rated.",45,1,5

It's much better than other fine dining restaurants i've tried.\n Me and my girlfriends ordered the Yamato ($200) and a bottle of sake. Our bill with tip came out to $300 per person. Pricey- but you get what you pay for. The quality is over the top amazing! Shout out to Chef Jackson\, Chef Tora\, Gary & Kiki because they made our entire experience so memorable. From the moment we walked in\, they took care of us with such detail and genuine kindness.\nWe were lucky to get reservations less than a week in advance. The restaurant is pretty small and intimate. It would be great for a date night\, though I don't recommend for groups larger than 4. We had 4 girls and that was already pretty tight. \nOverall\, I absolutely loved it here.

187,"Wako Japanese Restaurant",87,187,5,2017-10-2,"I have a soft spot in my heart for Wako because it was my first Michelin-starred restaurant and my first omakase menu when I moved to the Bay Area three years ago. I loved everything they served at that time\, including my first monkfish liver and an extraordinary chawanmushi (also my first) topped with uni. As a result\, I was afraid to go back for fear that things wouldn't be as good as I remembered them and I would be horribly disappointed. Thankfully\, I was wrong\, and when I went back at the end of June it was just as good.\nAmbiance and Service: It's a small\, warm space\, with lots of wood. Welcoming and relaxing rather than intimidating. We were a few minutes early for our reservation\, but were greeted and seated immediately. I prefer table seating because I don't like making conversation or reacting to food in front of the person who prepared it (just in case something isn't great). There's also a bar for those who prefer to watch the chef at work.\nThe staff is friendly\, deft\, and efficient\, working as a team to quietly tend to things before you even notice you need something. There was even a designated server whose job appeared to be just keeping an eye on things and swooping in to replace dropped napkins\, etc. Again\, all without being overly precious or intimidating the way upscale dining can be. My partner secretly told them it was my birthday\, but they didn't make an embarrassing scene\, which I hate. Instead\, they simply wished me a happy birthday by name when placing the dessert\, and threw a small handful of birthday confetti. I appreciated the reserve. \nOverall\, Wako continues to offer a pleasurable\, memorable\, and superior dining experience for a surprisingly good price\, especially in comparison to other SF omakase spots.",28,1,0

Service was great\, laid back but at the same time the second you need something they were right there. \nOur waiter had fantastic recommendations for wine and also did a great job of explaining how the filet mignon would normally be cooked so my pregnant wife could order accordingly so it wouldn't be undercooked yet also so it wasn't completely destroyed by overcooking such a great piece of meat.  \n I was also surprised that the pork chop that I ordered would normally be cooked medium-rare with significant pink which is not how I typically like my pork\, so by telling me that and having a conversation about it I knew that medium-well for me would be the right order and both came cooked perfectly.  A great example of wait staff working with the customer and the cooks applying that information in perfect harmony you just don't always see.\n Long story short\, I would highly recommend Boulevard\, and fortunately it is not an impossible reservation to get and I would say that the quality significantly exceeds the typical price point in SF for what you get.",1,0,0

I'm not so much into fine dining as of late\, but Eight Tables is definitely worth trying once.  We were seated in a super spacious booth (probably room for 5 though we were a party of 2).  The spaciousness really gives you the impression of private dining.  We started off the meal with a complementary glass of champagne and when we told our sommelier we didn't really drink\, he graciously brought us sparkling lemonade.  The potential embarrassment of drinking a kiddie beverage was tempered by the fact that he put as much effort in explaining the origins of the lemonade as he did the wines. \n You can find sample menus online - I won't go into detail for every dish\, but the highlights were definitely the Barbecue Shao Kao (crispy animal skin never disappoints)\, Foie Gras Potsticker\, and the tiny petit fours they served after the main dessert.  I wasn't too hot on the main dessert (Winter Melon Confit) - I thought it needed the addition of something more textural\, but everything else was a hit with me and my dinner-mate.  I love when I can taste the thought someone has put into the food\, whether it was the delightful addition of candied shiitake or the kumquat marmalade made in house.  It's the small things that make a dish. \n Our servers were amazing\, just the right amount of casualness to make us comfortable.

By long pauses\, I mean there were times that we thought something happened in the kitchen because nobody was getting any food. The pauses were 25-30 minutes long\, if you were lucky. Longer\, if you were unlucky. It was also excruciatingly hot in the dining area. It was so uncomfortable heat wise\, that I started losing my appetite because all I could focus on was the temperature in the room. \n Le bf and I will not be back. We had wanted to celebrate something special with a Michelin star meal\, but ended up very disappointed. We should have just stuck to some of our tried and true restaurants",5,1,5
234,Jardiniere,100,234,3.5,2014-7-2,"Love the space and sitting upstairs overlooking the bar is nice. A restaurant that has gotten too comfortable with its status and business. Service at the bar was great\, but waiter wasn't. Warm bread salad is good. My entree was meh\, friends entree was dessert. Dessert not memorable. Portions for entree on the smaller side. I would give it another chance.",0,0,0
