The menu come in the form of a poem so you will have a great time trying to guess what the next course will be. There were multiple courses (around 14 ish) and each course was a perfectly sized bite or taste of something delicious. I think there was much more gastronomy here than it other restaurants in sf (reminds me of my experience at guy savoy.) However, a couple of things prevents me from giving this place a solid 5 Star. This place was by far the most creative place I have been in sf but, compared to my experience at Coi, I don't think the flavors of any of the dishes were like WOAH! To be fair, between Coi and here, this place was more consistently good whereas Coi has hit or miss dishes. However, where Coi hit it really hit. Not sure what it is about this place but in every dish a particular flavor or texture prevented the ingredients from reaching their full potential (for example the crunchiness and flavor of the pastry tart and strong flavor of the Stone fruit of the uni geoduck tart prevented the uni flavor from really shining through.) Thus, I would probably say these places end up being around equal overall. Another thing is my bf has dietary restrictions which I mentioned when making the reservation. While the restaurant called to check what foods are ok and what are not, we still ended up being served a dish with an ingredient on his no eat list. That was a bit unfortunate and the restaurant was extremely apologetic... even going so far as to making other dishes extra special which I greatly appreciate. However, this experience was different from when I told Coi about my bf's restriction and they had prepare totally different entrees and dishes ahead of time to accommodate.

Eight Tables by George Chen honestly topped quite a few of them in terms of the dining experience.  The restaurant is hidden in the back of an alley in Chinatown, but once you step in, you will find out that it is a spacious and elegantly-decorated, luxurious venue with an army of well-trained staff who dress way better than you and are ready to pour your wine very generously.  During the meal, Chef Chen came to our table, greeting us and giving us a brief introduction about his concept on the dishes. I liked how he blended traditional Chinese sayings or concepts with a modern cooking method. For example, the first dish 'Jiu Gong Ge' represents the nine essential flavors of Chinese cuisine. I always think the first dish of a fine dining experience should be carefully set up because it will define the tone for the entire night. This first dish is like an opening of an opera or an introduction of the author of a book. From 'Jiu Gong Ge' and its presentation, I could immediately tell I would be guided through the journey of an authentic Chinese meal with a modern twist. One of the desserts was a sponge-cake-liked bite that I had when I grew up in China. It instantly brought back my childhood memories and gave a nostalgic feeling.  Our night was also made by Eight Tables' delightful and knowledgeable sommelier. The way he described the pairing wines made us feel entertained, welcomed, but also respected. Obviously, compared to him, we know very little about wine. However, he managed to channel his passion for wine in a very humble way which put us at ease.

On my last and final visit to this restaurant, my work bag and personal items were stolen from the valet service of Jardiniere. Here is my horrible experience at this restaurant from the food to the customer service. The awful meal and service:  When we arrived at the restaurant, the service was subpar. I ordered a glass of wine and it must have taken 15 minutes before it was served. The pour was skimpy, less than a quarter of the glass.  I ordered the duck entree and it was extremely dry and bland. The dish was tasteless, which was very surprising coming from a so-called nice restaurant. My friend, whom I was with, had a similar experience with his dish as well.  I ordered an espresso after the meal. We had to ask the waiter three times before it was brought. When the waiter finally brought the beverage, it was a cup of coffee. I had clearly stated three times I wanted espresso.  The stolen items by Jardinere Valet Service:  After work, I went directly to this restaurant. There was no parking on the streets so I valet parked my car with the restaurant. I placed my work bag and personal duffle bag in the trunk of my car. When I got home after dinner, the items were gone. I immediately called the restaurant and George Perezvelez, the manager offered to help. He promised to inform the owner of the restaurant and stated I will hear back from Traci Des Jardins within a day.  George also stated he would be off work the next two days, but will follow up. I returned to the restaurant the next day to take pictures of the valet sign to verify it had no disclaimer. To my surprise, I saw George at the restaurant. Not only did he lie about being gone, the owner never returned my email. Not to my surprise, I never heard back from this restaurant again. I tried to contact them several times, but I was given no response. I filed a police report with details of the incident.
