I have eaten hundreds -- probably thousands -- of tacos at taquerias in and around San Francisco as well as up and down the West Coast and throughout Mexico\\, New Mexico and Texas. I can without hesitation say that the tacos we had at at Street Taco were the worst I have ever had. The nice-looking homemade style corn tortillas were soggy\\, the texture of very wet cardboard.  The grayish meat had a similar texture. (The word 'mushy' comes to mind.)  Topped with a paltry dollop of not super fresh Pico de Gallo\\, the flavors melded to create a taste that was vaguely reminiscent of... well\\, of nothing.  To say the taste was bland would be inaccurate because 'bland' indicates the presence of at least some flavor\\, some taste.  These tacos were bizarrely virtually tasteless.  I mean I had to put salt on the tacos (on carnitas no less!) to sense any flavor.",

I arrived late 20 min late and was still able to experience the upstairs/lounge area and had some snacks or whatnot.  The dining environment was very different for me.  I'm always used to being in my own world and enjoying my food.  I'm not much of a social person and both parties from either side did not bother me.  Maybe they thought I didn't speak english?  Who knows.  My date loved the experience and food.  The food wasn't to my liking\\, but it was still very tasty.  For every meal\\, the chef will come out and explain how the dish was cooked.  That is a very nice touch and made the dining experience better.It was hard not to give them five stars but I've been to a lot of Michelin-starred restaurants lately and I feel that Benu's ambiance was not up to par with the likes of Quince or Atelier Crenn.  The dining hall felt dark and did not have the opulence or the warmth I experienced at other restaurants at this price level.  Service was good but not up to par with others (this is also an area where other two and three star Michelin restaurants excel).  It's a C for ambiance and a B- for hospitality.  I also wished they offered a non-alcoholic beverage pairing (other than tea) to really enhance the overall experience.I feel like I've checked off a bucket list item by coming here but I really don't think I would recommend Benu.  For $400 per person just for the tasting menu\\, I expected a fantastic overall experience but Benu fell a little short.",

The restaurant is absolutely amazing in terms of creativity\\, presentation\\, uniqueness\\, artistry\\, and the like... it makes you feel like you are really experiencing something very special! The menu come in the form of a poem so you will have a great time trying to guess what the next course will be. There were multiple courses (around 14 ish) and each course was a perfectly sized bite or taste of something delicious. I think there was much more gastronomy here than it other restaurants in sf (reminds me of my experience at guy savoy.) However\\, a couple of things prevents me from giving this place a solid 5 Star. This place was by far the most creative place I have been in sf but\\, compared to my experience at Coi\\, I don't think the flavors of any of the dishes were like WOAH! To be fair\\, between Coi and here\\, this place was more consistently good whereas Coi has hit or miss dishes. However\\, where Coi hit it really hit. Not sure what it is about this place but in every dish a particular flavor or texture prevented the ingredients from reaching their full potential (for example the crunchiness and flavor of the pastry tart and strong flavor of the Stone fruit of the uni geoduck tart prevented the uni flavor from really shining through.) Thus\\, I would probably say these places end up being around equal overall. Another thing is my bf has dietary restrictions which I mentioned when making the reservation. While the restaurant called to check what foods are ok and what are not\\, we still ended up being served a dish with an ingredient on his no eat list. That was a bit unfortunate and the restaurant was extremely apologetic... even going so far as to making other dishes extra special which I greatly appreciate. However\\, this experience was different from when I told Coi about my bf's restriction and they had prepare totally different entrees and dishes ahead of time to accommodate. All in all\\, I think this is a must try in sf and I would rate it above Coi because of its creativity. However\\, I think there is room to grow!!",

During the meal\\, Chef Chen came to our table\\, greeting us and giving us a brief introduction about his concept on the dishes. I liked how he blended traditional Chinese sayings or concepts with a modern cooking method. For example\\, the first dish 'Jiu Gong Ge' represents the nine essential flavors of Chinese cuisine. I always think the first dish of a fine dining experience should be carefully set up because it will define the tone for the entire night. This first dish is like an opening of an opera or an introduction of the author of a book. From 'Jiu Gong Ge' and its presentation\\, I could immediately tell I would be guided through the journey of an authentic Chinese meal with a modern twist. One of the desserts was a sponge-cake-liked bite that I had when I grew up in China. It instantly brought back my childhood memories and gave a nostalgic feeling.  Our night was also made by Eight Tables' delightful and knowledgeable sommelier. The way he described the pairing wines made us feel entertained\\, welcomed\\, but also respected. Obviously\\, compared to him\\, we know very little about wine. However\\, he managed to channel his passion for wine in a very humble way which put us at ease.

Thankfully\\, I was wrong\\, and when I went back at the end of June it was just as good.Ambiance and Service: It's a small\\, warm space\\, with lots of wood. Welcoming and relaxing rather than intimidating. We were a few minutes early for our reservation\\, but were greeted and seated immediately. I prefer table seating because I don't like making conversation or reacting to food in front of the person who prepared it (just in case something isn't great). There's also a bar for those who prefer to watch the chef at work.The staff is friendly\\, deft\\, and efficient\\, working as a team to quietly tend to things before you even notice you need something. There was even a designated server whose job appeared to be just keeping an eye on things and swooping in to replace dropped napkins\\, etc. Again\\, all without being overly precious or intimidating the way upscale dining can be. My partner secretly told them it was my birthday\\, but they didn't make an embarrassing scene\\, which I hate. Instead\\, they simply wished me a happy birthday by name when placing the dessert\\, and threw a small handful of birthday confetti. I appreciated the reserve. Overall\\, Wako continues to offer a pleasurable\\, memorable\\, and superior dining experience for a surprisingly good price\\, especially in comparison to other SF omakase spots.",

Service was great\\, laid back but at the same time the second you need something they were right there. Our waiter had fantastic recommendations for wine and also did a great job of explaining how the filet mignon would normally be cooked so my pregnant wife could order accordingly so it wouldn't be undercooked yet also so it wasn't completely destroyed by overcooking such a great piece of meat.   I was also surprised that the pork chop that I ordered would normally be cooked medium-rare with significant pink which is not how I typically like my pork\\, so by telling me that and having a conversation about it I knew that medium-well for me would be the right order and both came cooked perfectly.  A great example of wait staff working with the customer and the cooks applying that information in perfect harmony you just don't always see. Long story short\\, I would highly recommend Boulevard\\, and fortunately it is not an impossible reservation to get and I would say that the quality significantly exceeds the typical price point in SF for what you get.",

I'm not so much into fine dining as of late\\, but Eight Tables is definitely worth trying once.  We were seated in a super spacious booth (probably room for 5 though we were a party of 2).  The spaciousness really gives you the impression of private dining.  We started off the meal with a complementary glass of champagne and when we told our sommelier we didn't really drink\\, he graciously brought us sparkling lemonade.  The potential embarrassment of drinking a kiddie beverage was tempered by the fact that he put as much effort in explaining the origins of the lemonade as he did the wines.  You can find sample menus online - I won't go into detail for every dish\\, but the highlights were definitely the Barbecue Shao Kao (crispy animal skin never disappoints)\\, Foie Gras Potsticker\\, and the tiny petit fours they served after the main dessert.  I wasn't too hot on the main dessert (Winter Melon Confit) - I thought it needed the addition of something more textural\\, but everything else was a hit with me and my dinner-mate.  I love when I can taste the thought someone has put into the food\\, whether it was the delightful addition of candied shiitake or the kumquat marmalade made in house.  It's the small things that make a dish.  Our servers were amazing\\, just the right amount of casualness to make us comfortable.

So many great Michelin star restaurants in SF\\, this one will not blow you away.  Came here for my anniversary because I thought it would be cool to support a female chef. We need to support women and need more female chefs! So I'm sad that her food creations disappointed me. I think most yelp reviewers feel obligated to leave a good review to feel better for paying so much at this place or they have simply not dined at other restaurants in that price range. Why I disliked my experience: - the food combinations did not go well together. They sound and look good\\, but don't taste well. It was the first time I threw up after a fine-dining experience in particular it was her fish egg dish that had some weird combinations on and made me throw up the next morning.  - the place was SO loud. Not intimate and romantic at all. If you want a romantic atmosphere do not book.  - I thought the poetry thing that she does where she doesn't put the menu on the table but poems and as a riddle you have to try to make sense of it\\, was boring. I just wanted to know the dishes I was expecting\\, the poems thing was pretentious and it wasn't even witty. Nothing related to the food. - considering the price range\\, it was definitely not worth it. I advise you to take the money and book another restaurant with a nicer atmosphere and better food.",

The attention to detail is noteworthy\\, especially with the plates and the utensils. Quince also did something special for me - they set a table for me in the kitchen during my pasta portion.

Quince definitely had me impressed and intimidated at the same time. You just feel the luxury of their property the minute you step in and are greeted. I don't even think I touched the door when I arrived because someone was right there to open it for me.  I felt I really had to be on top of my etiquette game. I arrived a little early and was welcomed to wait in the lounge for my dinner partner.  I had a wonderful cocktail to start.  Upon my partner's arrival, we were quickly seated at our table and greeted by our servers.  I knew I was in for a crazy special meal when the first utensil was a tweezer for our canapé assortment.  It was details like that, knowing exactly what to use to serve each dish, and how to serve each dish so that it could be enjoyed immensely by the guest, that really made Quince a joy to dine at. The attention to detail and ability to serve an outstanding meal while still accommodating special requests is what I love about this place.  The menu had a birthday greeting at the top, the servers, including the bartender, were aware of the allergies we noted in the reservation and were careful to note what to avoid, and even when we left, the thoughtfulness to provide a warm cup of hot chocolate for me and hot tea for my partner who has a chocolate allergy as we left that night just made you feel extremely special and grateful for the experience to dine at Quince. This isn't a place I will be able to frequent often, but I will absolutely keep it in mind for very special occasions and make sure to recommend to people looking for a very special dining experience in San Francisco.  Cheers to you Quince and wishing you much continued success.",

We sat in a sectioned off room, away from the main dining room. There were 2 other tables so the setting was very intimate. The servers were very attentive, of course. The menu featured mainly white asparagus and our server told us the story behind it and how it is grown. Very fascinating as this was my first time trying it! Everything was plated very nicely and even though everything was small portions, we were full at the end. At the end, they had a dessert cart full of treats and you could choose anything on it!

There were all kinds of celebrations going on and different occasions of why people were there but all were special occasions no doubt. Its very relaxing and enjoyable from the first bite/sip to the end. I was trying very hard to be discreet about taking pictures so I could truly enjoy but my inner Yelpie had to take some pictures.
